# Attack-On-UI
An Attack On Titan Anime Inspired Bootstrap UI

I am the kind of person who thinks that, even when we are having fun, we should always strive to add value to our lives. This is why I created this UI 
inspired by Attack On Titan.

You can see the Figma design I made before developing this UI here: https://www.figma.com/file/xREppuduShwd2MtBxY1Fqd/Attack-on-UI?node-id=0%3A1
